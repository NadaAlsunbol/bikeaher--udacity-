### Description
In this project, _Python_ is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” _Chicago, New York City,_ and _Washington_. 
- The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience. 
- According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.

### **Statistics Computed:**
The code helps user to tell about bike share use in _Chicago_, _New York City_ and _Washington_ by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, the code output will provide the following information:

* Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):

  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day

* Popular stations and trip:

  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

* Trip duration:

  - total travel time
  - average travel time

* User info:

  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for _NYC_ and _Chicago_)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for _NYC_ and _Chicago_)
